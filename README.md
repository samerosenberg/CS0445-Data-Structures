Instructor: Sherif Khattab

Course Description:
This course emphasizes the study of the basic data structures of computer science (stacks, queues, trees, lists, graphs) and their implementations using the Java language. Included in this study are programming techniques which use recursion and reference variables. Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and are also expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.
